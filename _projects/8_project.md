This is a fun mini-project to learn about Generative adversarial networks(GANs). A DC-GAN has been trained on fish images from the dataset the QUT FISH dataset containing around 4k fish images(64 x 64)of various species. The code used for DCGAN and WGAN is taken from their official repositories. This project also discusses mode collapse in GANs and some ways to address it.
