Hi, welcome to my page :)

I am a third year Ph.D. student at the Khoury School of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University advised by Prof. Varun Mishra.
My overarching research interest lies in developing Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence systems that are more "behavior-aware"—capable of understanding users on a deeper level and supporting more personalized experiences. Currently, I focus on building human-centered AI and ML systems that use passive sensing data from phones and wearables to understand behavior patterns and generate meaningful health & well-being insights. My goal is to personalize these insights so it is accessible and actionable to a wide range of stakeholders—including behavioral researchers, psychologists, and individuals interested in health and wellbeing.

Prior to this, I worked as a software engineer (ML) at Amazon Search working with natural language processing/machine learning models to understand customers' intents from search queries on Amazon website.

I graduated with an MS(Hons) in Computer Science from the University of Southern California. While, at USC, I was part of the <a href="https://somalab.usc.edu/about/">Social Media Analytics</a> lab and <a href="https://www.ihp-lab.org/">Intelligent Human Perception</a> lab. I worked on several research projects involving multimodal machine learning, affective computing, social media analysis, and dialogue systems.

I hold a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Palakkad.

To learn more about me, here is my <a href="/assets/pdf/phd_cv.pdf">CV</a>.

Currently, I live in Boston. In my spare time, I like to workout, travel, read and write poems, paint, make cocktails. Lately, I’ve been learning to sailing ⛵



I am looking for applied scientist/data scientist **internship opportunities** for **Summer 2026**. If you have an interesting opportunity, please reach out at **choube.a@northeastern.edu**.
