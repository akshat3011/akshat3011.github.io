Hi, welcome to my page :)

I am a software engineer at Amazon Search working with natural language processing/machine learning models to understand customers' intents from search queries on Amazon website. My research interests are in using Machine Learning to build “behavior-aware” intelligent systems in the education and healthcare domain. Specifically, this involves:
<ol type="i">
  <li>Developing computational models of human affective, cognitive, and psychological states.</li>
  <li>Analyzing verbal and non-verbal social signals using multimodal Machine Learning (ML).
</li>
  <li>Using learnings from (i) and (ii) to design intelligent systems that support the learning and assistive needs of people.
</li>
</ol>

I graduated with an MS(Hons) in Computer Science from the University of Southern California. While, at USC, I was part of the <a href="https://somalab.usc.edu/about/">Social Media Analytics</a> lab and <a href="https://www.ihp-lab.org/">Intelligent Human Perception</a> lab. I worked on several research projects involving multimodal machine learning, affective computing, social media analysis, and dialogue systems.

I hold a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Palakkad.

To learn more about me, here is my <a href="/assets/pdf/phd_cv.pdf">CV</a>.

Currently, I live in San Francisco. In my spare time, I like to go on hikes, travel, read and write poems, and paint. Recently, I have been learning to mix drinks &#127864;
