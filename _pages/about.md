Hi, welcome to my page :)

I am a software engineer at Amazon Search working on natural language processing and machine learning applications. My research interests involve designing computational systems to model and modulate human behavior.

I graduated with an MS(hons) in Computer Science from University of Southern California. Meanwhile, at USC, I was part of the Social Media Analytics lab and Intelligent Human Perception lab. I worked on several research projects involving multimodal machine learning, affective computing, social media analysis, and dialogue systems.

I hold a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Palakkad.

To learn more about me, here is my <a href="/assets/pdf/akshat_cv.pdf">CV</a>.

In my spare time, I like to go on hikes with friends, travel, read and write poems, and paint. Recently I have been learning to mix drinks &#127864;
