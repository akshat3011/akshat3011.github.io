It's just a normal day   
I wake up thinking about you   
Thinking about what would your love feel like   
Will your touch feel as soft as the pillow beneath my head?   
Or will your arms feel like home?   
Will you hold me tighter than my blanket?   
Will it feel as cozy and warm?  
Will your kiss on my forehead make my head lighter  
Or will it make my heart beat faster?  
Will I drown in your eyes or will I be hooked on your lips?  
Will I be floating in clear skies or would It be harder to breathe?  
Will I be in awe of you or Will you be the same?  
Will we be in love or just make love?  
Will you let me touch your heart or only your body?  
All these thoughts drive me crazy only to be saved by your good morning message
