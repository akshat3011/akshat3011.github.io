Somewhere between I found you and you found me  
we found each other  
For months it felt like  
we are two souls in a single body...  
Although that were dark times for me  
but your gracious presence settled my nerves...   
I could barely see light   
but your feel made my world light up...   
You cared for me   
You loved me like no one else could do...   
You took all the pain and never let it reach me   
You shaped me in the most magnificent way you can...   
Finally, the most awaited day of our lives came   
there were few people out there to attend the ceremony   
You were so happy,   
and finally, I was near u   
I glared at this new world of you and me   
and as expected I cried   
You held my hands and you are still holding them...   
Thanks, mom for bringing me to this world   
and loving and supporting me in my tough times...
