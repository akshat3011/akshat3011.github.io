Let's run away to the hills      
be innocent kids  
Let's be the sunshine that never fades  
be the one who stays  
Let's meet at the everglow  
move a bit slow  
Let's be spring and bloom  
Be the road that takes me home  
I be the tempest and you be the calm ocean  
I be the radio and you be the silence  
I be the wolf and you be my full moon   
Be my solace in summer   
Oasis in vast desert   
Be my sun in winters   
The light thats guide me   
Let's be the magic   
Be the sound of rain   
Let's be a tatoo on each others heart   
Let's be everything  
Let's be us
