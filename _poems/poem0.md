Crowded queues, masks, and shields on our faces,  
I am still more suffocated by the thought of you never being mine  
So many people, the heaters on,  
Still can't feel the warmth that you make me feel  
Crowd murmuring, constant announcements,  
Still, the only voice I want to hear is yours   
Slow-moving lines still moving faster than our dynamics   
So many bags and suitcases on my shoulder  
Still, my heart feels heavier    
you don't need security checks to figure out the hidden love     
Still, I can't accept that I love you neither can I deny   
Feels like all those display screens are screaming this truth   
I wait because it is the only thing I can do   
I can't break lines, nor I can rush   
I wait and wait till it's my turn to drop the baggage at the counter   
And all I ask them is if they can also take this load away from my chest?
