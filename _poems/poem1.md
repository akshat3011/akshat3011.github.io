Finding your feel in other arms       
Random flashbacks and random hookups   
Swinging moods and  enigmatic emotions   
Wanting you to come back and not   
Fickleness in my mind and in your heart   
I am lost in the past searching for our future   
Finding bits and pieces to corroborate our love   
The love we shaped but couldn't solidify   
The love that faded away before memories  
The love that you just reduced to lust   
The relationships, the pain, the goodbyes all unacknowledged   
The huge mountain of emotions  
The river of tears down my pillow   
The promised moon unfulfilled   
The limitless sky that we never touched   
The unfathomable depth of your brown eyes   
The warmth in your words and arms  


I am here in the middle of a dream that I saw   
But the sky isn't as blue   
The river doesn't make that melody   
The nightingales don't sing  
The time doesn't slow anymore  
The air is not magical  
And me, not the king   

I am the beggar begging for just more of you  
Starving for the love you once gave  
With stitched heart and clothes   
Drenched in the dirt of betrayal   
Trying to be rich again...    
Closing walls and building a fort    
A fort unbreakable by cupids arrow    
With a tomb for our love within...
