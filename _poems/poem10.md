While we were strolling the streets  
When I told you I think I am beginning to know you  
Remember you asked me what your favorite color was  
I stood completely blank questioning myself   
Do I really know you if I don't know your favorite color   
But then I know blue in you when you feel calm as a beach on a sunny day   
I know crimson red in you when I feel the heat while we make love   
I know black in you when I am lost somewhere in your eyes   
I know golden when you are being kind to strangers   
I know yellow, orange, a tinge of green, and every other color in you   
So yeah, I might not know your favorite color   
But don't worry I will love you like all the colors you know of ;)
