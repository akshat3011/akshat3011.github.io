Walking you back home midnight so I can stay longer with you  
In the light of thousand stars, you shine like one of them  
And I am just an astrologer who admires every part of you  
Your radiance has burned an impression on my heart    
A memoir of our love or a scar of war   
Surely a lasting mark   
I want to wake up to you   
Spend my afternoon filled with nothingness with you   
Wander aimlessly in the evenings   
Watch stars with you every night   
and walk you back to our bedroom
