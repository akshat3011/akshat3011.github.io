Chasing unpromised love is like a bullet in your chest  
It's like a lighthouse without light  
It's warm yet not comforting  
It's like pills that steal your sleep  
It's the hope that you know is gonna break  
It's like the sun all bright but you can never touch  
It's like the moon calming you for that hour in each other's arms  
It's broken and yet not beautiful  
It's gross, it has no ends or no beginnings  
With shallow foundations waiting to collapse any moment   
Constantly looking to build itself with someone else  
It's like that expensive dress that you want but you can never get it  
It's desire, not a need  
It's like feeling hurt when you know you should not    
It's like acting all fine by the day and crying at night     
It's like this poem all unstructured and meaningless yet trying to convey something   
It's not anybody's mistake but yet both are at fault   
One naive enough to not understand casual relationships   
The other... oh my... there lies no fault   
After all, it was unpromised
