My past memories refreshed when I saw a fellow        
He said me hello !!        
Joy filled over my heart       
He was once my life’s part         
He was like pearl in this vast sea        
He was filled with joy too after seeing me…           
I first met him in jail when I was in sorrow       
He consolidated me by saying there will be a better tomorrow       
We both were innocent           
There was nothing to repent         
He was 24355 & I was 24356        
He was my Old Acquaintance      
He was a handsome man in his young days      
But now what to say      
He has gone so pale after spending too much time in jail        
Few days ago he has got his bail     
He glanced at me & cried    
Not to cry I tried      
We talked well      
It was like finding happy memories in this earthly hell      
I enjoyed his company      
His voice for me was like honey      
Soon the time drained       
Soon there was time of arrival of his train      
He said bye     
I wanted to cry      
But with a smile said bye      
Hope that soon again I will again say hi       
Although we live within a large distance      
But I will never forget my Old Acquaintance...
